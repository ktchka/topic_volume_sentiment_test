Compared to other platforms, fees feel similar; what matters more is the property's communication and local rules. I always double-check the cancellation policy and message the property through the platform rather than using external links. Most stays are uneventful: the listing matches, the key pickup works, and I move on. If I need a refund, I insist on getting written confirmation from both the host and the platform. When traveling with friends, I always verify the exact bed setup and room count before paying. Paying on-platform has saved me from headaches a few times when a host tried to change terms last minute. If something looks off, I take screenshots of listings and messages in case I need support to review the timeline. Local regulations can affect tax and ID requirements, so I read the fine print to avoid surprises.",
